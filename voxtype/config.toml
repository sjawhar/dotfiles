# State file for external integrations (Waybar, polybar, etc.)
# Use "auto" for default location ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voxtype/state),
# a custom path, or "disabled" to turn off. The daemon writes state
# ("idle", "recording", "transcribing") to this file whenever it changes.
# Required for `voxtype record toggle` and `voxtype status` commands.

# Options: tiny, tiny.en, base, base.en, small, small.en, medium, medium.en, large-v3, large-v3-turbo

# Options:
#   - Single language: "en", "fr", "de", etc.
#   - Auto-detect all: "auto"
#   - Constrained auto-detect: ["en", "fr"] (detects from allowed set only)

# See troubleshooting docs for the required Hyprland submap configuration.

# Post-processing command (optional)
# Pipe transcribed text through an external command for cleanup before output.
# The command receives text on stdin and outputs processed text on stdout.

# On any failure (timeout, error), falls back to original transcription.
