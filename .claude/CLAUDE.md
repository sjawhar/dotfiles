## Version Control (jj)

This user uses [jj (Jujutsu)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) with a squash workflow:

- All changes accumulate in a single working copy change
- Don't create new commits for fixes—just make changes and re-push
- Don't re-describe commits when pushing
- Push with `jj git push`. Add `--named=<bookmark_name>=@` to create a new branch from the current commit.
