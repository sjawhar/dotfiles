description: "Run type-checker, bug-finder, and code-simplifier on recent changes"
---

Analyze the code I just wrote or modified. Run these three agents **in parallel**:

1. **type-checker** - Improve type safety, replace Any types, add proper annotations
2. **bug-finder** - Find subtle bugs, edge cases, and potential failure modes
3. **code-simplifier** - Check for unnecessary complexity and simplification opportunities

After all three complete, provide a unified summary:
- Critical issues that need immediate attention
- Type safety improvements to make
- Simplification opportunities
- Suggested fixes with code examples where helpful
