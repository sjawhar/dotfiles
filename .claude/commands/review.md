description: "Review current changes using the code-reviewer agent"

Review my current uncommitted changes using the **code-reviewer** agent.

First, run `jj diff` to see what has changed, then launch the code-reviewer agent to thoroughly analyze the changes for:
- Correctness and potential bugs
- Adherence to project conventions
- Type safety issues
- Security concerns
- Test coverage gaps
- Code quality and maintainability

Provide structured feedback with severity levels (blocking, important, suggestion).
